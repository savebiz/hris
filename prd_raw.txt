Executive Summary  
The DataGuard Employee Portal is an internal web -based Human Resource Information 
System (HRIS) designed to centralize employee data, automate HR workflows, and provide 
self-service capabilities for both Core Staff and Support Staff. The system addresses c ritical 
delays in HR service delivery by establishing a single source of truth for employee records, 
reducing manual processes, and enabling data -driven operational decisions[1][2].  
This PRD defines the technical requirements, feature specifications, data structures, user 
roles, and implementation roadmap for a two -phase deployment prioritizing speed, usability, 
and security.  
 
Product Vision and Objectives  
Vision  
To build a simple, secure Employee Portal that empowers DataGuard staff with self -service 
capabilities while providing HR with centralized data management and reporting tools.  
Primary Objectives  
• Establish single source of truth for all employee data (Core and Support Staff)  
• Reduce manual HR processes by 50 -70% through automation and self -service[1]  
• Support HR reporting and operational decision -making with real -time data  
• Ensure system usability requires minimal training for all staff categories  
• Deploy Phase 1 within 6 -8 weeks to address current service delivery delays[2]  
Success Metrics  
• 95% data accuracy post -migration  
• 80% user login rate within Week 1 of launch  
• Leave approval cycle reduced to $<$48 hours  
• $<$5% support tickets per week post -stabilization  
• HR administrative time reduced by 50% within 3 months[1]  
 
User Roles and Access Levels  
The system implements role -based access control (RBAC) with three distinct user types:

3. Post -Migration Validation  (Week 6)  
• Spot -check 20% of records for accuracy  
• Reconcile leave balances with HR records  
• Test user logins and access permissions  
• HR final approval on migrated data  
Rollback Plan:

Risk Management  
Technical Risks  
Risk  Impact  Mitigation  
Data migration errors  High: Incorrect 
employee records  Rigorous testing, phased import, 
validation checks[2]  
System downtime during 
launch  Medium: Delayed 
adoption  Staging environment testing, off -
hours deployment  
Security breach  High: NDPR 
violations, data loss  Encryption, MFA, regular 
security audits, penetration 
testing[5]  
Poor performance with 
scale  Medium: Slow 
response times  Load testing, database indexing, 
caching strategy  
Integration failures 
(email/WhatsApp)  Low: Missed 
notifications  Fallback to manual notifications, 
API retry logic  
 
Table 11: Technical risk register  
Organizational Risks  
Risk  Impact  Mitigation  
Low user 
adoption  High: System 
underutilization  Change management, training, 
executive sponsorship[2]  
Resistance to 
change  Medium: Continued 
manual processes  Early involvement, champions 
program, success stories  
Scope creep  Medium: Delayed launch  Strict Phase 1 scope, change request 
process  
Insufficient HR 
capacity  Medium: Data quality 
issues  Dedicated HR resource, temporary 
support during migration  
Budget overruns  Low: Project delays  Bootstrap -friendly tech stack, phased 
delivery[3][4]
