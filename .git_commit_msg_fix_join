fix: fetch leave balances separately to avoid sql join errors

- Updated getLeaveRequests to fetch leave_requests and leave_balances independently.
- Merged data in server action.
- Updated UI to display Duration and Balance with fallback N/A.
- Prevents page crash if leave_balances table is missing.
